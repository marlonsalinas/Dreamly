        Advice for lucid dreaming
    </h1>

        <p>
            One of the most imporant things about learning how to lucid dream is understanding what a lucid dream actually is, and how to recognize when you're dreaming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A lucid dream can be defined as a dream in which you've realized that you're dreaming and even gain the ability to freely manipulate the things happening around you. Lucid dreaming gives you the opportuninty to do things that wouldn't be possible in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step you can take to help you recognize when you're in a dream state is writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up. Over time, this can help you remember key details of your dreams more vividly, making it easier to spot the key differences between real world interactions and those that you have in your dreams. The easier that it is for you to realize that you are in a dream state, the easier it'll be to lucid dream.
        </p>

            The second step you can take to help you recognize when you're dreaming is to give yourself reality checks throughout the day. This can be achieved by simply looking at the clock or giving yourself a small pinch. Using the small pinch as an example, in the real world you'll feel an immediate sensory response to the pinch, but in a dream state you might get a warped sensory response or maybe not feel anything at all. This could help you realize that you're not in reality, but in your own dream, which is ultimately the goal of performing these reality checks.
        </p>

            It may take some time for you to have your first lucid dream; it's a slow process. It comes faster for some people, and slower for others. However, it's important to stay consistent with these methods no matter what category you fall into in order to gain the ability to lucid dream as frequently as you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time you realize you're dreaming, you might find that the dream ends abruptly afterwards. This is because of your sudden excited state. As hard as it may be, it's important to stay calm and treat the experience as nothing out of the ordinary in order to remain asleep. Over time, you'll find it easier and easier to stay asleep when you realize you're dreaming. You may find it in your best interest to manipulate your dream in small ways and work your way up. Realizing you're dreaming and immediately beginning to fly is a quick way to get too excited and wake up. Try making something small appear in front of you to start off and slowly building up from there. There is no fun in lucid dreaming if you wake up before can take advantage of the opportunity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lucid dreaming gives you the opportunity to do incredible things that could never occur in reality. Teaching yourself this ability is a fun, harmless way to make dreaming more fun and purposeful. Implement these strategies into your everyday life and you'll soon learn how to lucid dream like a pro!
